# ScatteringResults

An unabridged collection the proton radii extracted from electron scattering data. 

Of course there is only one true proton radius which of course is what all the authors 
of the various papers are trying to extract via their differnt methods for doing the
extraction.   

Currently CODATA recommends using the muonic result but for historic reasons, the plots
include the CODATA-2014 recommended value.
